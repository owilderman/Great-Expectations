My dream job is a forecast meteorologist at the National Weather Service, specifically at the Storm Prediction Center. 

I've always had a fascination with storms and the weather. Severe weather captured both my heart and my fear at a young age. As I've grown older I've learned not to fear but instead be facsinated with the weather. I want to help people and make storm prediction and forecasting more accurate for more people, more often.
